您好👋 這裡是蔡漢霖的 Github 主頁

My name is **Hanlin Cai**. I am a junior majoring in Automation at [Fuzhou University] (China) and Robotics and Intelligent Devices at [Maynooth University] (Ireland, Combined Degrees). I gain a CGPA of 3.79/4.00, ranking top 10% in my major. Recently, I have been nominated for the 2021-2022 **China National Scholarship** (top 0.1%). 🎊

Currently, I am interested in **IoT (Internet of Things)** and **ML (Machine Learning)**. The paper focusing on the IoT real-time intelligent garbage monitoring system with the aid of my supervisor ([Chin-Hong Wong]) has been ACCEPTED by 2022 [IEEE CENIM]. Besides, I am currently attending a summer research project organized by the University of Cambridge under the guidance of [Prof. Pietro Lio'] to design an ML-based testbed for IoT cybersecurity research. 🚀
