您好👋 這裡是蔡漢霖的Git主頁

My name is **Hanlin Cai**. I am a junior majoring in Automation at [Fuzhou University] (China) and Robotics and Intelligent Devices at [Maynooth University] (Ireland, Combined Degrees). I gain a CGPA of 3.79/4.00, ranking top 10% in my major. Recently, I am nominated for the 2021-2022 **China National Scholarship** (top 1%). 🎊

Currently, I am interested in **IoT (Internet of Things)** and **ML (Machine Learning)**. Also, the IEEE conference paper focusing on the IoT in smart cities in CENIM 2022 with the aid of my supervisor ([Chin-Hong Wong]) will be published in Oct. 2022. Besides, I am currently attending a summer research project organized by the University of Cambridge (CCISTC) under the guidance of [Prof. Pietro Lio'] and exploring an ML-based scheme for IoT security. 🚀
