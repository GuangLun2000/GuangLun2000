Here is Hanlin Cai (Lance, 蔡汉霖).

I am a first-year PhD student in the Internet of Everything Group at the University of Cambridge, where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Ozgur Akan, and advised by Prof. Jon Crowcroft and Dr. Kai Li. My research is supported by the Cambridge Trust and CSC Scholarships. Previously, I had the privilege of conducting summer research with Prof. Pietro Liò in the Artificial Intelligence Group.

Prior to joining Cambridge, I worked on wireless networks and cybersecurity under the guidance of Prof. Zhezhuang Xu and Dr. Meng Yuan. Additionally, I was honored to be selected as an outstanding undergraduate scholar at leading AI conferences, including AAAI 2024 and SIGKDD 2024.

I am always open to academic discussions and potential collaborations. Please feel free to reach out to me at hc663 [at] cam.ac.uk
